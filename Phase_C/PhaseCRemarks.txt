- System can only handle single files
- For very similar files, similarity score was appropriate
- In one comparison case, some file content seems to be cut off	

- Very good work on UI - although code highlighting would have been very helpful
- Panes showing code could be of equal lengths	Installation was very easy - no issues faced as such	

- Exceptions are simply printed on the console (e.printStackTrace()) - could have been handled better, could have been logged or displayed as an error message, etc
- In several places, variables are declared with over-specific types such as HashSet<Integer>, where Set<Integer> would have suffices and made the design more flexible. Similarly, methods are declared with over-specific types.	

- ReadMe was detailed and listed all steps 	

- Tests could use more descriptive names
- Some amount of dead code	

- All members have similar number of commits
- As a team they created 13 branches - the team acknowledged all issues on GitHub by reviewers	- For some cases the similarity % reported was very low for two files despite identical snippets
