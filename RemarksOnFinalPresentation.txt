• overall, good presentation covering algorithm, tool, some aspects of the design
• tool looks good, nice self-help instructions on start-up
• side-by-side diff is helpful, but doesn't highlight the lines that are different (TA comment: ""Very well designed application – code highlighting would have been incredibly helpful or at least segregation of similar code snippets"")
• limited to single-file comparison
• tool provides interesting view that illustrates how ASTs are normalized
